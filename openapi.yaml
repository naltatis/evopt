  title: EV Charging Optimization API
  description: |
    Mixed Integer Linear Programming model for EV charging optimization based on the EOS (Energy Optimization System) formulation.

    This API optimizes energy management systems with battery storage and grid interaction capabilities, maximizing economic benefit by:
    - Minimizing grid import costs
    - Maximizing export revenue 
    - Considering final state of charge value

    The optimization model includes:
    - Power balance constraints
    - Battery dynamics with charging/discharging efficiency
    - Grid flow direction constraints
    - Operating and storage limits

    **Mathematical Formulation:**

    Objective: Maximize Σt(-nt*pN + et*pE) + Σi(si,T*pai)

    Subject to:
    - Power balance: Σi(ci,t - di,t) + ft + nt = et + gt ∀t
    - Battery dynamics: si,t+1 = si,t + ηc*ci,t - (1/ηd)*di,t ∀t,i
    - Grid flow constraints when pN ≤ pE
    - Operating limits: 0 ≤ ci,t ≤ cmax_i, 0 ≤ di,t ≤ dmax_i
    - Storage limits: smin_i ≤ si,t ≤ smax_i

      summary: Optimize EV charging schedule
      description: |
        Solves a Mixed Integer Linear Programming problem to optimize EV charging schedules.

        The optimization considers:
        - Multiple batteries (EV batteries, PV storage)
        - Time-varying energy demands and production forecasts
        - Dynamic grid import/export prices
        - Battery operational constraints
        - Charging/discharging efficiency losses

        Returns optimal charging/discharging schedules for all batteries and grid interactions.
